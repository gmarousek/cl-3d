* DONE xs:NMTOKEN is not found
  - The solution to this is to either get rid of NMToken or add
  xs:NMTOKEN function/class to cl-xsd
  - For not its best 

* DONE networking.lisp (inline is also present in another package) 
  - class inline causes package lock exception. Also inline::load
    does the same. The solution is to simply shadow the two symbols.

* DONE rendering.lisp 
  - normal class has an attribute called 'vector' and causes
    package-lock exception. Solved by shadowing vector in package.lisp

* DONE geometry-3d.lisp
  - types with NIL should not have default values in ()
  - types should not be specified

* DONE programmable-shaders.lisp
  - same issue as geometry-3d.lisp

* DONE types.lisp are not getting generated
* DONE Children should have a special mechanism to be dealt with
  XMLisp has a way to add a list of some element by adding a method 'add-subobject
* DONE MFColor and SFColor functions should be defined
  MFColor is not well defined. Need to redefine this in the future
* DONE Let all default values be strings
  - String get converted to values only when visited by methods.
  - This means that we need to have basic conversion utilitiy
    function from string to the defined types.
