#+SEQ_TODO: TODO CURRENT DONE

* DONE Implement run method for transform
* TODO Implement the basic logic of operation
** TODO read the scene into a *SCENE* global variable
** TODO  run the root node
   some logic has to come in this place for dealing with sensor nodes. May be
   the sensor nodes have to be dealt with first before anything else. I would
   like to see something like REPL to deal with such.
   read->eval->print or Control->Model->View or Input -> Processing ->Output

   So our main logic wil be read all the sensor nodes and start the evaluations.

   IDEA: Alternatively it would be good to explore what hapens if there are
   multiple sensor nodes and each starts its own thread of execution
