   some logic has to come in this place for dealing with sensor nodes. May be
   the sensor nodes have to be dealt with first before anything else. I would
   like to see something like REPL to deal with such.
   read->eval->print or Control->Model->View or Input -> Processing ->Output

   So our main logic wil be read all the sensor nodes and start the evaluations.

   IDEA: Alternatively it would be good to explore what hapens if there are
   multiple sensor nodes and each starts its own thread of execution
